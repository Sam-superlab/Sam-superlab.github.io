## Graph Tips(General)
- Identify and think about the quantity on each axis
- Pay attention to units and powers of 10
- Assign meaning to the gradient of the graph and the area under the curve-use units to help(eg. Gradient has units=$\frac{y}{x}$)

### Graph Tips---Gradients
The gradient of a graph represents the instantaneous rate of change of $y$ with $x$, denote as $\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta y}$

>Example: $F=\frac{\Delta P}{\Delta t}$

### Force vs. Distance
Area under the curve = Work

### Acceleration vs. Distance

Area under curve=$\frac{\text{Work}}{\text{mass}}$

### Force vs. time(Important)
Area under the curve = Impulse

>Impulse = $F\Delta t=\Delta p$
