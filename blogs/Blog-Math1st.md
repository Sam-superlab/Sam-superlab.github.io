# Why Math story

During my early years experience, I had totally different concepts and perspectives in Math. These shifting ideas represent the changes that occur in my personal experience and my philosophy of education. Initially, my father introduced me to calculus through a comic to ignite my interest in Math. However, as a primary student. I found it rather tedious compared to the captivating world of physics. This early phase, where mathematics did not resonate with me. 

In middle school, my perspective on math shifted. The challenge and the ability to achieve high grades became motivating factors. This stage is crucial as it often marks the transition from viewing math as a tedious subject to seeing it as a series of challenges to be conquered. It's interesting to note that, for me, the allure was not initially in the beauty or utility of math but in the challenge it presented.

In High school, I started to do Math research. I began to notice the inherent beauty of mathematics from my diverse research topics like distinct prime divisors of odd perfect numbers, noticing the symmetry and elegance in concepts like isomorphism and bijection. Math is worthy not just for its challenge or utility, but for its aesthetic qualities â€“ much like one appreciates art.

Just like Grand Sanderson, I aimed to invite more and more students to enjoy the beauty of math. Hence I began to do some seminars that introduce different content in math during my free time in school. 

 Mathematics as an art form, where joy and satisfaction come from exploration and understanding rather than practical application, is a perspective shared by many mathematicians and enthusiasts. This perspective is aligned with what some mathematicians like G.H. Hardy have expressed, valuing the beauty and purity of mathematics for its own sake.
