## The number thoery question

$$n^2|3^n+1$$ where $n$ is a positive integer.

This is a question I found in internet. I think it is interesting. I will try to solve it later.

we shall let $p$ as the smallest prime factor of $n$.
Then we have $p^2|3^n+1$ and $p|3^{n}+1$ therefore $3^n\equiv -1(\mod p)$
