最近终于结束了我三年的IB生涯。不管是在考试前的一切压力和不安还是考试途中的迷茫，可以肯定的说这半个月绝对是最煎熬的日子。正所谓轻舟已过万重山，现在正是那样的感觉。
但是学习不会因为一次考试而结束，我在这段时间学到的最重要的事情就是---小考小玩，大考大玩，不考不玩。只有平时认真的学习了才会在面对考试时有松弛感.

Recently, I finally ended my three-year IB career. Whether it is all the pressure and uneasiness before the exam or the confusion on the way to the exam, it is certain that this half month is definitely the most painful day. As the saying goes, the canoe has passed thousands of mountains, and now it feels like that. But study will not end with an exam. The most important thing I learned during this period is to play in the small exam, play in the big exam, and don't play in the exam. Only when you study hard at ordinary times will you feel relaxed in the face of the exam.
