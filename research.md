# Research Interests

My research interests lie in the areas of combinatorics, graph theory, and number theory. I am particularly fascinated by the elegant patterns and structures that emerge in these mathematical fields.

## Current Research

I am currently pursuing research in mathematics at Grinnell College, focusing on theoretical aspects of number theory and their applications.
