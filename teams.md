# Sam's Superlab
I studied in the Chinese curriculum for 12 years and one thing that most people told me is that 'learning and education are only to cope with screening tests.' I always doubted this notion, for me, education is not just a tool the government uses to screen students. From my perspective, knowledge is my lifelong pursuit and one of the major tools to maintain social equity and achieve social justice. 

I once attended a learning support project in an impoverished mountainous area in Sichuan. During home visits to students, I learned that children there go to school simply because they offer free meals. They don't have the same opportunities as children in urban areas. I understand that each stage of further education is an allocation of educational opportunities, and in addition to the "learning ability", family, region, urban and rural, and other factors cause "inequality of educational opportunities."

Hence I created a platform that aims to benefit the whole community by sharing knowledge. I recruited a team of like-minded students from manifold subjects and sincerely explained my vision and aspirations to them. I shared my philosophy, 'It is impossible to achieve full equality in education in any society, but inequality can be reduced. We, as part of the community, have a responsibility to contribute to it. This project is our opportunity!' With this philosophy in mind, I created 'Sam-Superlab'.

On this online platform, I gathered and published their study notes and techniques. I then secured allies such as teachers to help with peer review. We next aimed to express our ideas and beliefs beyond our campus walls by conducting physical and chemical experiments and teaching at nearby schools. By giving these young learners experiences they never had, I hoped to ignite their enthusiasm for STEM subjects, give back to the community, and help raise the next generation of scientists. My leadership and time management skills were cultivated through creating this platform. More importantly, I benefited the community.
