## [Sam's Superlab(notes)](https://ssr-web-sam.vercel.app/)

Sam-Superlab is an online platform I created with the mission to make quality educational resources accessible to all students. On the platform, I gathered a team of students from diverse disciplines to share their study notes, techniques, and insights across various subjects. These materials are peer-reviewed by teachers to ensure accuracy and usefulness.

Our goal is simple: to democratize access to knowledge and empower students, especially those in underserved communities, by providing them with the tools they need to succeed academically.You can find all notes by this [link](https://ssr-web-sam.vercel.app/)

## [Machine-Learning-Visualization---K-Means-Clustering](https://github.com/Sam-superlab/Machine-Learning-Visualization---K-Means-Clustering)

This project provides an interactive visualization of the K-Means clustering algorithm, allowing users to understand how the algorithm works through dynamic visual feedback. The application is built using Python, Streamlit, and Plotly, and it supports various initialization methods and datasets.

## [Decision-Tree-Visualization](https://github.com/Sam-superlab/Decision-Tree-Visualization)

This project provides an interactive visualization of the Decision Tree algorithm, allowing users to understand how the algorithm works through dynamic visual feedback. The application is built using Python, Streamlit, and Plotly, and it supports various initialization methods and datasets.

## [python-trading-engine](https://github.com/Sam-superlab/python-trading-engine)

This project is a Python-based trading engine that allows users to simulate and test trading strategies. It provides a flexible framework for implementing various trading algorithms and supports real-time data simulation.
