## Aim
to investigate illusory correlation

## Participants
- 39 people, 26 in A and 13 in B
- Groups had the same proportion of positive vs negative traits

## Procedure
- Researchers asked participants to read descriptions of two made-up groups (Group A) and (Group B).  
- Descriptions were based on many positive and negative behaviors.  
	- Group A (majority group) - twice as many members than B; performed 18 positive and 8 negative behaviors.  
	- Group B (minority) - performed 9 positive and 4 negative behaviors.  
- Asked to attribute behaviors to group.

## Results
- Although there was no correlation between group membership and the types of behaviours exhibited by the groups, in that the proportion of negative and positive was the same for both groups, the participants did seem to have an illusory correlation.  
- More of the undesirable behaviours were attributed to the minority Group B, than the majority of Group A.

## Conclusion
- The findings are based on the idea that distinctive information draws attention.  
- Group B members and negative behaviours are both numerically fewer and therefore more distinct than Group A members and negative behaviour, therefore, stands out more than the combination of Group A members performing such behaviours causing illusory correlation.

## Evaluation
Artificial  
- Stereotypes far more ingrained than being shown slides - doesn't replicate a real-life scenario  
Applicable (ish)  
- Can explain why negative stereotypes may be more common for minority groups than for the majority  
- Such research led to many countries not reporting the race/ethnicity of the offender
