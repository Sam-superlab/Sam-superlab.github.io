# Hobbies

## Basketball

I have played Basketball for about 12 years and I am now the captain and the coach of my school basketball team. I delve into basketball because it is fantastic when the ball just goes into the basket. This is the link to the basketball team: [Basketball team](https://sam-superlab.github.io/file/Basketball-Team/)

## Workouts
I am interested in doing Workouts and it helps me find peace inside me.

I like to play video games, especially sandbox games.
- Terraria
- Minecraft
