# Hobbies
## Basketball

I have played Basketball for about 12 years and I am now the captain and the coach of my school basketball team. I delve into basketball because it is fantastic when the ball just goes into the basket. This is the link to the basketball team: [Basketball team](https://sam-superlab.github.io/file/Basketball-Team/)

## Workouts

I started workouts for about 1 year, and when I was in grade 9, I was about 220 pounds and for now I have already lost 50 pounds of weight. The reason why I lost weight is mainly because my dad was sick and obese during COVID-19 isolation. I wanted to help him and engage him so we just losing weight together. Later, instead of becoming a person who only works out for health, I am a bit beyond that. I look forward to doing some natural physique competition.
