## Overview
Buttelmann et al. (2007) studied how chimpanzees imitate a model who uses unusual body parts to press a panel to switch on a display. The model performed under two conditions: in one, their hands were free, and in the second condition, their hands were unavailable.  The chimpanzees were faced with a model of a different species. 

The study applied the head-touch task and the sit-touch task. The head-touch task was developed by Gergely et al. (2002). The sit-touch task was developed by Buttelmann, Carpenter, Call, and Tomasello (2007).

The results indicated that a majority of 2.5-year-olds (75%) in the true-belief condition helped E2 by opening the box that E2 had just tried to open.
## Evaluations
- The study was conducted in a lab with a controlled environment and a control group. 

Buttelmann et al. also conducted a study on children's use of false-belief to determine how to help in a paradigm. This study compared mentalistic and non-mentalistic interpretations of preschoolers' helping behavior.
### Limitations
- The study did not include an order where the sound modality was administered as the first modality of the task. 
- The study had limited statistical power because children needed to complete a pair of tasks to be included in each set of inter-task analyses. 
- 119 of the 16- and 18-month-olds were excluded from the analyses, resulting in a final sample of 50 infants in each group.
