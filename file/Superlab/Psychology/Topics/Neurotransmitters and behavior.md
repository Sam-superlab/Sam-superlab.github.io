## Concepts
- [[Neurons]] 
- [[Neurotransmissions]] 
- [[Neurotransmitters]] 
## Issue
There has been criticism of reducing the explanation of behavior to the workings of neurotransmitters alone. Can a complex human behavior like falling in love with someone be attributed to a simple “love cocktail” of dopamine and norepinephrine?
## Different Neurotransmitters
1. [[Dopamine]]
2. [[Acetylcholine]]
3. [[Norepinephrine]]
4. [[Serotonin]] 

## Neurotransmitters and their effects on behavior
- [ ] Synapse
- [ ] Agonist
- [ ] Antagonist

Serotonin
Inhibitory
