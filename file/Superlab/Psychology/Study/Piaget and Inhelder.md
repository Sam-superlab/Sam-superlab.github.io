## Aim
- The extent to which children of different ages were able to take in the view of another person  
- Children's overall system of putting together a number of different views of what they see

## Participants
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">100 students  </mark>
Age: 
- (4-6.5) 21
- (6.5-8) 30
- (8-9.5) 33
- (9.5-12) 16

## Procedure
1. 3 mountains, the highest being grey and the shortest being green. Brown is in the middle.  
2. Children were asked to pick from a group of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">10 pictures</mark> to show what the scene would look like from different viewpoints 
3. Children were then shown a viewpoint and were asked to place a doll so that she could 'see' what the picture was showing
## Results
- 4-6.5 yrs choose pictures from their view, even if asked from another perspective(egocentrism)  
- 7-9 yrs <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">start to understand </mark>that there is a different viewpoint  
- 9-10 yrs<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> fully understand</mark> that the doll would see something else from them

## Evaluations
### Strength 
- Provided a great deal of detail in their methods and results  
- Gave qualitative data rich in detail and depth, looking in detail at the child's error and their stage of development  
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Used experimental methods with careful controls which allowed accurate comparisons to be made  </mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Repeating the study with 100 children gave the experiment reliability</mark>
### Limitations
- 'Stage' is too strong for development, as children were observed to transition quite progressively from one to the other
- Other studies gave different results  
- Helen Borke(1975) made the method more child-appropriate by adding Grover from Sesame Street and made the table spin- 79 percent of the time 3-year-olds were right and 93 of 4-year-olds were right  
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Only Swiss sample was tested(lack of generalizability)</mark>
